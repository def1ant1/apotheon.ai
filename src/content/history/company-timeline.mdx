narrative: >-
  Apotheon.ai spun out of a multi-agency research consortium with an explicit focus on
  operationalizing responsible autonomy. The founding charter bound engineering and
  governance to a shared audit ledger so that every experiment could be replayed,
  inspected, and ultimately certified for regulated missions.

[//]: # 'Editorial tone: lead with verifiable facts and avoid unverifiable superlatives. Tie every milestone to documented controls or customer outcomes.'
[//]: # 'Keyword hygiene: include “responsible autonomy”, “audit ledger”, and “regulated missions” where contextually appropriate to reinforce SEO targets without keyword stuffing.'
[//]: # 'Sourcing discipline: cite primary research repositories or audit trails in the body copy when new claims are added.'

Founders merged systems engineering, mission assurance, and applied ML research practices
under a single governance surface. This milestone anchors the company narrative in provable,
compliance-forward R&D instead of hype cycles.
