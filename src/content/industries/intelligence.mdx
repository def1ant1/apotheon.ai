  headline: Intelligence-grade AI for analytic overmatch
  copy: Cross-domain data fusion, collection tasking automation, and analyst collaboration engineered for national and commercial intelligence teams.
  icon: intelligence
pressures:
  - title: Intelligence cycles need machine-speed data fusion
    description: Analysts spend critical time reconciling multi-source feeds instead of generating assessments that inform strategic decision makers.
    metric: 62% of analytic time is consumed by manual data conditioning across intelligence enterprises.
  - title: Collection orchestration lacks adaptive prioritization
    description: Collection managers require dynamic tasking that reflects mission changes and risk posture without sacrificing oversight.
    metric: 48% of mission adjustments trigger manual retasking processes across collection platforms.
  - title: Dissemination must respect classification and need-to-know
    description: Briefings and reports have to flow through compartmented channels with precise auditability to maintain trust and legal compliance.
    metric: 5x growth in post-incident classification audits since new disclosure mandates.
complianceHighlights:
  - framework: ICD 503 + NIST SP 800-53 High
    highlight: Embedded control inheritance, automated auditing, and zero-trust segmentation keep intelligence systems accreditation-ready.
    evidence: ICD 503 authorization package supplemented with continuous monitoring feeds.
  - framework: Intelligence Community Data Management (ICD 501/506)
    highlight: Fine-grained tagging, dissemination controls, and need-to-know governance align with intelligence sharing directives.
    evidence: Metadata policy catalog with automated enforcement telemetry.
  - framework: CUI + Insider Threat Programs
    highlight: Behavioral analytics, session isolation, and privileged monitoring maintain CUI controls while supporting rapid collaboration.
    evidence: Insider threat dashboard with anonymized alert workflows and audit-ready reports.

  # Automation guard: align intelligence overlays with Themis and Mnemosyne slugs post-rebrand.
  - slug: themis
    positioning: Provides cross-domain data fabrics with lineage, tagging, and policy enforcement for multi-level security environments.
    outcome: 55% faster production of multi-source intelligence summaries.
  - slug: nova
    positioning: Enables high-side experimentation sandboxes and analytic model deployment with compartmented approvals.
    outcome: 3-week reduction in model validation cycles for analytic tradecraft upgrades.
  - slug: mnemosyne
    positioning: Powers mission-aware knowledge graphs that surface signals, hypotheses, and watchlist changes in real time.
    outcome: 45% drop in redundant analytical leads flagged by multiple teams.
