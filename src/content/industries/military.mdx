  icon: military
pressures:
  - title: Joint all-domain command requires fused situational awareness
    description: Component commands still operate on siloed battle rhythms, delaying decisions that demand synchronized intel, logistics, and effects chains.
    metric: 58% of joint planners report manual data fusion as their biggest delay to synchronized operations.
  - title: Authorization cycles slow emerging capability deployment
    description: New software increments stall on RMF documentation and cybersecurity approvals, limiting rapid combat capability fielding.
    metric: 210-day average to reauthorize mission systems when evidence is assembled manually.
  - title: Contested environments strain observability and resilience
    description: Deployed forces need self-healing telemetry and automated anomaly detection to survive degraded communications and cyber attacks.
    metric: 4x increase in contested spectrum incidents logged during multinational exercises last year.
complianceHighlights:
  - framework: DoD Cloud Computing SRG IL5/IL6
    highlight: Secure enclaves, cross-domain guard integrations, and continuous monitoring satisfy impact level accreditation requirements.
    evidence: Package with DISA Provisional Authorization alignment and inherited controls catalog.
  - framework: RMF + NIST SP 800-53 High Baseline
    highlight: Automated control evidence, POA&M lifecycle management, and workflow traces accelerate ATO sustainment.
    evidence: Continuous RMF dashboard with machine-generated control status updates.
  - framework: DISA STIG Automation
    highlight: Hardened configuration baselines and remediation automations keep mission apps compliant in fielded environments.
    evidence: Weekly STIG compliance reports with automated remediation plans.
