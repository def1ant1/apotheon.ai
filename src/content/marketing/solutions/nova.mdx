[//]: # 'NOTE: HERO SLOT CONTRACT — Include "AI" in the headline to align with high-intent queries.'
[//]: # 'NOTE: Lead CTA should reference governance or security themes to resonate with compliance teams.'

## Reproducible ML Pipelines

Nova provisions GPU-capable sandboxes with Terraform-backed infrastructure modules. Data scientists
spin up notebooks, connect to governed datasets, and commit experiments back into the shared model
registry with lineage preserved.

## Policy-Driven Launch Gates

Every deployment flows through approval workflows that log reviewers, test evidence, and rollout
plans. Nova integrates with Slack and Jira to collect sign-off without forcing teams into new tools.

## Human-in-the-Loop Monitoring

Dashboards surface bias drift, hallucination rates, and SLA compliance with alerts routed to on-call
rotations. Explainability reports export directly to PDF so risk teams can archive audits without
scripting custom jobs.
