[//]: # 'NOTE: HERO SLOT CONTRACT — Include "AI" in the headline to align with high-intent queries.'
[//]: # 'NOTE: Lead CTA should reference governance or security themes to resonate with compliance teams.'
[//]: # 'SECTION LAYOUT — Start with reproducibility narrative to reassure data science leads before exploring operations.'

## Reproducible ML Pipelines

Nova provisions GPU-capable sandboxes with Terraform-backed infrastructure modules. Data scientists
spin up notebooks, connect to governed datasets, and commit experiments back into the shared model
registry with lineage preserved.

[//]: # 'SECTION LAYOUT — Use policy section to detail approval workflows; consider embedding flow diagrams later.'

## Policy-Driven Launch Gates

Every deployment flows through approval workflows that log reviewers, test evidence, and rollout
plans. Nova integrates with Slack and Jira to collect sign-off without forcing teams into new tools.

[//]: # 'SECTION LAYOUT — Monitoring story should end the article so CTA cards can extend into observability demos or audits.'
[//]: # 'CTA INTERPLAY — Mention dashboards and alerting to justify CTA actions like "Request monitoring workshop".'

## Human-in-the-Loop Monitoring

Dashboards surface bias drift, hallucination rates, and SLA compliance with alerts routed to on-call
rotations. Explainability reports export directly to PDF so risk teams can archive audits without
scripting custom jobs.

[//]: # 'NOTE: EXTENSIBILITY — Future authors can embed live code samples via fenced blocks. Prefer TypeScript for SDK snippets to align with our primary developer ecosystem.'
[//]: # 'NOTE: CTA ROW STRATEGY — Include cross-links to Atlas/Clio where joint deployments amplify Nova experiments.'
