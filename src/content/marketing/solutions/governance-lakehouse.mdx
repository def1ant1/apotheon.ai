[//]: # 'NOTE: HERO SLOT CONTRACT — This summary feeds meta descriptions and Pagefind search so keep the copy laser-focused on governance outcomes.'
[//]: # 'NOTE: CTA COPY — Reference automation or controls to meet procurement expectations during evaluations.'

## Compliance Evidence Without Copy-Paste Drudgery

Centralize attestations, model cards, DPIAs, and policy mappings in a versioned warehouse so audits replicate with a single click. The lakehouse ingests signals from Jira, GitHub, and our agentic governance APIs, automatically tagging controls with their latest verification timestamp.

[//]: # 'NOTE: DATA SOURCES — Sourcing automation keeps the page aligned with our "no manual spreadsheets" principle.'

## Continuous Risk Scoring and Routing

Risk profiles update in real time as launches progress through automated tests, red-team reviews, and legal checkpoints. When thresholds tip, the control plane opens work items for the accountable teams, auto-populates evidence packets, and escalates through Slack or email without human triage.

## Audit-Ready Exports at Infinite Scale

Generate regulator-friendly binders, ISO/SOC mappings, and board dashboards from the same governed data layer. APIs stream structured JSON for downstream analytics while the UI lets non-technical reviewers download PDF snapshots without waiting on engineering.

[//]: # 'NOTE: EXTENSIBILITY — Downstream automations should call exported APIs instead of duplicating the evidence warehouse.'
