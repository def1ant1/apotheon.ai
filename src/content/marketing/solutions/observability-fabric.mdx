[//]: # 'NOTE: HERO SLOT CONTRACT — Headlines and summaries should emphasize automation to satisfy SRE and platform engineering stakeholders.'
[//]: # 'NOTE: CTA — Each CTA must map to an enablement workflow owned by marketing operations.'

## End-to-End Signal Ingestion

Instrument LLM prompts, human review activity, API calls, and infrastructure metrics through the same streaming pipeline. Pre-built collectors normalize payloads with privacy-safe redaction so platform teams avoid writing bespoke ETL jobs for every workflow.

## Automated Anomaly Correlation

The fabric layers statistical detectors with reinforcement learning policies to flag drift, hallucinations, and SLA breaches. When issues emerge, the system spins up impact assessments, tags the affected tenants, and routes alerts to the correct on-call rotation in Slack, Teams, or PagerDuty.

[//]: # 'NOTE: ALERT STRATEGY — Automation-first routing keeps the story consistent with the homepage modules.'

## Operability Insights for Every Persona

Executives receive curated scorecards, engineers drill into live traces, and compliance teams pull immutable audit events—all backed by the same warehouse. APIs and webhooks allow downstream tooling to subscribe once and stay synchronized without manual exports.
