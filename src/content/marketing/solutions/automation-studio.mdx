[//]: # 'NOTE: HERO SLOT CONTRACT — Position Automation Studio as the bridge between governance and delivery velocity.'
[//]: # 'NOTE: CTA — Pair verbs like "Book" or "Launch" with outcomes to reinforce value during sales handoffs.'

## Compose Human + Agent Flows Together

Build guided workflows by dragging agentic tasks, manual approvals, and integration steps into a shared canvas. Studio enforces type-safe contracts between steps, automatically generating test harnesses and environment-specific secrets so deployments stay deterministic.

## Enterprise-Grade Guardrails by Default

Role-aware policies restrict which personas can launch or edit flows, while built-in change management logs every modification. Integration scaffolds pull credentials from the centralized vault, eliminating copy-paste secrets and manual rotation tasks.

## Continuous Optimization and Insights

Closed-loop analytics capture cycle times, reviewer load, and success metrics for each flow. Automation Studio suggests SLA tweaks, experiment branches, or AI prompt adjustments, then queues improvements for teams via Jira, Asana, or ServiceNow.
