[//]: # 'RESEARCH PLAYBOOK: Update cohort + integration tables in lockstep with Pagefind indexing. Run npm run build so the static search bundle captures edits immediately.'

## Academic partnership program

We operate multi-year memoranda of understanding with universities and federal labs that specialize in resilient automation, policy assurance, and evaluation science.

- **Joint research boards** at MITRE, CMU, and Stanford review every dataset before it enters the platform, aligning with IRB approvals and export-control guidance.
- **Dual-rail publication tracks** allow partners to ship peer-reviewed papers alongside applied playbooks surfaced in the Apotheon.ai docs hub.
- **Evidence-first collaboration** keeps board minutes, experiment telemetry, and audit artifacts in the same ledger so compliance checkpoints are never lost.

> Contact [research@apotheon.ai](mailto:research@apotheon.ai) to nominate new cohort members. We rotate invitations twice per year and publish selections in the handbook changelog.

### Active partner cohorts

| Cohort                   | Focus area                                                            | Current milestone                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sovereign AI Observatory | Zero-knowledge proof systems for multinational data residency         | Q3: Deploying FedRAMP-aligned verification harnesses inside Nova tenants                            |
| Trace Ethics Consortium  | Bias detection and remediation frameworks across healthcare + finance | Q2: Publishing comparative drift analysis results via the Sovereign AI Assurance whitepaper refresh |
| Mission Systems Lab      | Field-deployable AI orchestration for classified environments         | Q4: Delivering IL5 sandbox blueprints with attested runtime policies                                |

## FEDGEN and Trace Synthesis integration

![FEDGEN and Trace Synthesis data exchange diagram](/static/diagrams/research/fedgen-trace-synthesis.svg)

The research hub federates deterministic provenance (FEDGEN) with Trace Synthesis replay pipelines so every experiment emits audit-ready telemetry.

1. **FEDGEN broker** validates partner uploads against consent lineage policies, encrypts corpora using tenant-managed keys, and stages zero-copy escrow in R2.
2. **Trace Synthesis fabric** distills features, applies fairness instrumentation, and exports replay bundles with deterministic seeds for reproducibility.
3. **Governed Nova sandboxes** hydrate the replay bundles, enforcing adaptive guardrails through Clio before researchers access controlled GPUs.

Each stage produces signed manifests stored alongside the [Sovereign AI Assurance whitepaper](/about/white-papers/), making compliance reviews self-service for legal and policy stakeholders.

## Researcher onboarding guidance

- **Sandbox provisioning** — Submit a request via the hero CTA or [RevOps contact form](/about/contact/?team=research) with your institution’s compliance officer copied. RevOps automates background checks and drops credentials within one business day.
- **Data ingestion** — Run `npm run ensure:research-intake -- --dry-run` locally (documented in the private ops handbook) before transferring corpora to confirm schema alignment. The workflow emits manifests consumed by FEDGEN.
- **Publication workflow** — Draft findings in MDX under `src/content/marketing/research/` child folders. Include `[//]: # "PUBLISHING"` annotations so peers understand required automation. Ship updates through Pull Requests to trigger Pagefind reindexing.

> **Automation note:** Whitepaper metadata syncs from `src/content/whitepapers`. Run `npm run ensure:whitepapers` before updating download descriptions so checksum manifests stay aligned with the delivery Worker.

## Next steps

- Review the [downloadable resources](#downloadable-resources) table and capture experiment intents in `docs/content/CALENDAR.md`.
- Use the sandbox CTA to request credentials, then coordinate integration testing with the FEDGEN team via the Trace Synthesis Slack bridge.
- Schedule quarterly retrospectives with Apotheon.ai research program managers to ensure academic roadmaps and enterprise releases stay synchronized.
