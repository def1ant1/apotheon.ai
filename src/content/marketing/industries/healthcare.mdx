## Integrated Clinical Data Fabric

We connect EHR, lab systems, and connected devices through standardized FHIR APIs with automated
PHI redaction. Healthcare providers receive governed data marts that support research, operational
insights, and patient outreach without duplicating sensitive data into shadow databases.

## Care Team Workflow Automation

Use Atlas automation recipes to deliver discharge instructions, follow-up surveys, and medication
reminders via secure communication channels. Clinicians approve templates once, and the platform
keeps content synchronized across languages and accessibility needs.

## Population Health Outcomes

Combine claims, social determinants, and patient-reported data to identify rising risk cohorts.
Executives receive dashboards tuned for value-based care metrics, while analysts can export trusted
CSV snapshots for deeper modeling.
