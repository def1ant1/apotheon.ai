[//]: # 'Maintain plain-language explanations that map directly to the history milestones so investors and regulators can cross-reference claims quickly.'
[//]: # 'Cite source systems (e.g., audit ledger, deployment runbooks) when adding new sections to preserve verification discipline.'

## Why we publish a verifiable timeline

Apotheon.aiâ€™s go-to-market and regulatory posture is anchored in transparent documentation.
By consolidating milestones into a single, auditable surface we give diligence partners a
fast path to confirm the operational rigor behind every announcement.

## How to propose new milestones

1. Draft the milestone in `src/content/history/` and include sourcing notes inline so reviewers
   can trace facts back to the appropriate evidence system.
2. Run `npm run ensure:history-media` to generate derivatives and provenance manifests for any
   supporting media assets.
3. Request a review from the Governance Operations team; they will append provenance IDs and
   update compliance checkpoints detailed in `docs/dev/HISTORY.md`.

## Versioning expectations

Timeline updates ship alongside change logs recorded in the internal audit ledger.
Product, compliance, and go-to-market leads sign off jointly before entries leave draft status.
