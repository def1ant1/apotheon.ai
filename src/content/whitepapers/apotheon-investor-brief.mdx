  distribution: Position as the fastest path to understand Apotheon.ai's
    defensible pipeline mechanics, expansion levers, and compliance
    differentiators without an NDA.
  reviewerChecklist:
    - Confirm all ARR, GRR, and NRR references align with the latest RevOps
      board pack (update the appendix timestamp on drift).
    - Validate competitive landscape statements against the approved
      intelligence brief to avoid disclosing embargoed field learnings.
    - Ensure regulatory roadmap slides cite the live certification IDs from the
      trust center before shipping.
    - Verify every investor CTA routes to the
      `/about/contact/?team=investor-relations` flow so analytics and automation
      stay linked.

{/* Investor enablement reminder: keep metrics referenced here synchronized with the RevOps data warehouse snapshot published each sprint. */}

### Inside the briefing

- **Financial momentum** — Summarizes multi-year ARR trends, gross retention, and expansion levers with cohort visualizations that align with board reporting.
- **Regulated AI moat** — Details policy automation, guardrail telemetry, and certifications underpinning platform defensibility in healthcare, finance, and the public sector.
- **Execution roadmap** — Provides the next six quarter milestones, talent expansion plans, and enterprise GTM sequencing curated for diligence partners.

### How to distribute safely

- Always send the signed URL generated by the whitepaper delivery Worker; never attach the PDF to email or chat threads.
- Tag every CRM activity with the `investor-relations` campaign code so attribution reconciles with marketing automation telemetry.
- When prospects request editable slides, escalate to Investor Relations for watermarking and updated checksum tracking before release.

> Automation note: The delivery Worker records download telemetry in D1 so Investor Relations can audit access patterns during diligence cycles.
