gatingNotes:
  distribution: Emphasize sovereign control, on-prem deployment options, and
    zero-trust telemetry; avoid suggesting Apotheon hosts classified workloads.
  reviewerChecklist:
    - Verify every control mapping aligns with the current DISA STIG appendix.
    - Confirm supply-chain language references the approved SBOM policy
      statement.
    - Ensure all diagrams reference sanitized architecture layers cleared by the
      security review board.

### Why this matters now

Sovereign missions are accelerating AI adoption but require verifiable guardrails before leadership green-lights production rollouts. This guide outlines how Apotheon.ai satisfies assurance mandates without bespoke engineering.

### What you will learn

1. **Policy-aware orchestration** — How Clio and Nova coordinate to ensure every inference records provenance and guardrail outcomes.
2. **Evidence retention blueprint** — Blueprint storage strategies that align with RMF control families and NATO cross-domain guidelines.
3. **Operational readiness drills** — Tabletop exercises automation teams can run to certify escalation workflows before go-live.

### Usage guidelines

- Route public-sector distribution through approved campaign IDs so the analytics pipeline can attribute interest to the correct mission theater.
- Attach the R2 signed URL to Salesforce campaign responses; RevOps will reconcile acceptance logs nightly.

> Automation reminder: The whitepaper delivery Worker runs MX checks for non-allowlisted domains and records the signed URL expiry in D1. Security analysts review the ledger weekly.
