## Why we built an automation-first editorial stack

Our delivery teams despise manual content pipelines almost as much as brittle AI workflows. The blog ships with the same guardrails we deploy in customer environments:

- **Typed content collections** enforce hero art, author data, and OpenGraph contracts so no release lacks polish.
- **CI-integrated linting** runs Vitest, Playwright, and type checks on every branch—mirroring the release gate we run for production infrastructure.
- **Search automation** leans on Pagefind to re-index automatically after `npm run build`, meaning knowledge management stays in sync with our launch cadence.

## What you will find here

1. **AIOS architecture deep dives** that break down the operating system powering regulated launches.
2. **Continuous learning playbooks** balancing reinforcement learning with compliance.
3. **Integration governance** references that keep vendor ecosystems observable.
4. **Industry spotlights** showcasing sector-specific results—starting with healthcare.

Each article inherits shared components for author bios, structured data, and related content scoring. The new `/blog` index lets you filter by tag or sort by publish date without leaving the page.

## How to contribute

1. Clone the repo, add your MDX file under `src/content/blog/`, and follow the inline metadata prompts.
2. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run test:e2e`, and `npm run build` locally to mirror the release gate.
3. Attach diagrams, quotes, and CTA guidance inline—automation will pull the rest together.
