## Situation snapshot

A regional health network needed ambient documentation, scheduling automation, and diagnostics support across 42 facilities. Requirements included HIPAA, HITRUST, and state privacy compliance.

> “The automation is invisible to patients, but the safety checks are undeniable to auditors.”

### Deployment overview

- **Week 1-2** — Provisioned the AIOS with dedicated healthcare overlays, connected Epic and Cerner sandboxes, and ran synthetic data rehearsals.
- **Week 3-4** — Activated human-in-the-loop review using clinician champions, layered prompt safety gates, and configured OG Worker placeholders for provider communications.
- **Week 5** — Rolled out ambient scribing to cardiology and urgent care teams with progressive feature flags.

### Clinical readiness checklist

### Outcomes after 90 days

| Metric                       | Baseline      | 90-Day Result |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Clinician documentation time | 3.2 hrs/day   | 1.8 hrs/day   |
| Audit exceptions             | 7 per quarter | 1 per quarter |
| Patient satisfaction         | 82 NPS        | 89 NPS        |

The healthcare spotlight demonstrates how the new blog, feeds, and OG automation roadmap work together: stakeholders receive timely updates, compliance officers trace every change, and marketing teams get consistent artwork once the Worker launches.
