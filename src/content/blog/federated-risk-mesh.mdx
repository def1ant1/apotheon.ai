## Why federated risk meshes outperform centralized review boards

Regulated enterprises cannot rely on a single approval queue for every model or prompt template. Instead, risk meshes decentralize decision making while keeping policy as code:

1. **Codify critical controls** â€“ Map data residency, prompt safety, and audit retention policies to automated guardrails instead of tribal knowledge.
2. **Delegate with context** â€“ Each product domain owns a "cell" in the risk mesh, aligning local OKRs with enterprise safety thresholds.
3. **Observe everything** â€“ Shared telemetry, especially reinforcement learning feedback loops, surfaces leading indicators before impact.

  <strong>Automation first.</strong> Every safeguard described here integrates with our `workers/`
  alerting pipelines and Pagefind search indexesâ€”no bespoke dashboards required.
</div>

## Implementation checklist

- Bootstrap a governance backlog seeded from your regulatory inventory.
- Wire policy controls into CI/CD using [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) or a native alternative.
- Subscribe the security operations center to the AI-specific incident feed generated by our Webhook worker.
- Iterate on quarterly game days to ensure response plans stay fresh.

## Metrics that matter

Track indicators that prove your safeguards scale:

- Mean time to detect anomalous model behavior.
- % of user-facing prompts covered by bias/abuse guardrails.
- Incident runbooks validated in the last 90 days.

## Whatâ€™s next

Our roadmap includes publishing the federated mesh terraform modules and integrating policy drift detection into the public status page. Subscribe below to join the private beta.
