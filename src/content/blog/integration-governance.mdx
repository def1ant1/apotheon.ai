## Why integrations need first-class governance

Third-party APIs and AI services expand faster than procurement charters. Apotheon.ai codifies integration governance in three stages:

1. **Intake** — Capture vendor metadata, data residency, model provenance, and SOC/ISO evidence via automated questionnaires.
2. **Runtime** — Inspect payloads for PII, enforce throttling, and verify every call includes a trace identifier for downstream audits.
3. **Lifecycle** — Automate renewal reviews, re-certification, and offboarding workflows with D1-backed checklists.

> “A vendor without observable guardrails is a liability masquerading as innovation.”

### RACI table

| Responsibility     | Product | Security | Legal | Procurement |
| ------------------ | ------- | -------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Intake checklist   | A       | C        | R     | C           |
| Runtime monitoring | R       | A        | C     | I           |
| Renewal review     | C       | R        | A     | A           |

### Control automation layers

- **API contract validation** — JSON schema validation runs in the Worker edge, blocking requests that fall outside the approved surface area.
- **Secrets orchestration** — The AIOS injects vendor credentials at runtime via short-lived tokens minted in Vault; rotation policies live in code, not spreadsheets.
- **Incident loop** — Integration anomalies trigger PagerDuty playbooks that link directly to vendor runbooks stored in the blog’s upcoming knowledge base.

We are shipping starter Terraform modules next quarter so customers can bootstrap these guardrails on day one. Subscribe to the feeds and keep an eye on Epic 14 updates for automated OG reporting tied to vendor scorecards.
