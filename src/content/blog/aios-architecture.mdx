## Platform principles

The AIOS is intentionally modular so enterprises can compose capabilities without re-platforming legacy estates. Every service aligns to one of three planes:

1. **Experience plane** — Customer-facing interfaces, including Radix-powered consoles and embedded analytics widgets.
2. **Orchestration plane** — Workflow engines, guardrail services, and delivery automation triggered by GitOps.
3. **Data plane** — Feature stores, evaluation sandboxes, and model registries hardened with column-level lineage.

> "If a capability cannot be proven deterministic, it does not belong in the control plane." — Rahul Patel

```

### Automation hooks

- **OG artwork pipeline** — Each blog entry references a `generatorRequestId`. Once Epic 14 lands, the Worker will accept these identifiers, synthesize OpenGraph art, and update feeds in one sweep.
- **Observability** — Distributed tracing spans wrap every ingestion and inference service. Exporters are preconfigured for OpenTelemetry and Splunk Enterprise.
- **Compliance as code** — Policies compile into Rego modules and TypeScript validators. The same bundles feed CI checks, runtime enforcement, and audit exports.

### Implementation backlog

| Epic                       | Dependency            | Owner         | Target |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| 12: Multi-region inference | Platform Networking   | SRE Guild     | Q3     |
| 13: Autonomous rollback    | Release Engineering   | Core Platform | Q3     |
| 14: OG Worker automation   | Marketing Engineering | Web Platform  | Q4     |

The architecture is ready for production pilots today. Follow the breadcrumbs in `/docs` for environment-specific overlays, and subscribe to the feeds to watch the backlog converge in real time.
