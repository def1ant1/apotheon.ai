# Draft placeholder: capture metadata early so schema validation keeps future edits honest.
#
# Editorial workflow crib notes:
# 1. Keep this metadata block current even during outline phases—the automation in
#    `npm run typecheck` catches drift before review.
# 2. Once stakeholder sign-off lands, update the hero asset + description, flip
#    `draft` to false, and commit alongside the final copy edit.
# 3. After publishing, append an `updatedDate` field when making material changes
#    so JSON-LD + feeds inherit the right timestamps.
# title: Use executive-ready phrasing. No trailing periods and keep under 90 chars.
title: 'Building AI Vendor Scorecards that Survive Board Scrutiny'
# description: 140–160 characters for SEO/social. State the outcome readers achieve.
description: 'Placeholder draft capturing outline + stakeholders for upcoming procurement guide'
# publishDate: ISO-8601; target go-live date to sequence teasers + release notes.

# heroImage / heroImageAlt: optional until creative delivers. Keep alt text plain-language.
heroImageAlt: 'Scorecard wireframe awaiting final illustration'
