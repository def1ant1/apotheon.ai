This playbook codifies the enterprise-grade launch routine for Apotheon.ai. Every
step favors automation over one-off console work so we can rehearse, audit, and
repeat the launch procedure without drift.

## 1. DNS Cutover Runbook

- **Pre-flight validation**
  - Export the current DNS zone via API (`cloudflare zones export`). Store the
    snapshot in the `infra` repository with the change ticket ID for traceability.
  - Execute `npm run build` and `npm run workers:synthetic:dry-run` against the
    staging stack. The synthetic dry-run must return `status: healthy` before
    we touch DNS.
- **Automated switch**
  - Use the infrastructure pipeline (Terraform/Cloudflare API) to swap the
    `apotheon.ai` origin from staging to production. Avoid manual toggles inside
    the Cloudflare dashboard—changes need to flow through Git-backed IaC so we
    can reproduce the same switch in rehearsals.
  - Apply traffic weights gradually when blue/green is enabled (start at 10%,
    observe synthetic metrics for 5 minutes, then ramp to 100%).
- **Post-cutover verification**
  - Re-run the synthetic Worker in live mode (`wrangler deploy --env
synthetic_health && wrangler tail`) to confirm `/api/contact` and
    `/api/whitepapers` still return audit IDs within latency budgets.
  - Execute `npx dig apotheon.ai` from at least two regions to confirm TTLs and
    CDN POPs have absorbed the new records.

## 2. Cache Warmup & CDN Readiness

- Trigger the warmup script (`npm run build && node scripts/ci/ensure-ladle-output.mjs`)
  to prime static assets and OG imagery before the first user hits the site.
- Fire the synthetic Worker immediately after warmup so the contact and
  whitepaper caches contain fresh responses. This also seeds D1 with the first
  production run for observability.
- Verify the incident banner endpoint (`/synthetic-health` Worker) returns
  `status: healthy` with at least two checks populated. Capture the JSON payload
  in the launch ticket for audit history.

## 3. Rollback Drills

- **One-click Worker rollback**
  - Run `wrangler deployments list --env <worker>` for every Worker and capture
    the latest deployment IDs.
  - Execute `wrangler rollback --env <worker> <deployment-id>` in staging to
    confirm the command path still works. Script this via CI so we never rely on
    manual CLI inputs during production incidents.
- **Static asset rollback**
  - Store the previous `dist/` artifact in object storage (S3/R2) with a timestamp.
    Rolling back becomes a single `rclone sync` rather than a frantic rebuild.
- **Synthetic regression gate**
  - After simulating rollback, rerun `npm run workers:synthetic:dry-run`. The
    command must fail (non-zero exit) if either API returns anything but a
    healthy response, guaranteeing we catch hidden regressions before rolling
    forward again.

## 4. Alerting & Incident Verification

- **Synthetic Worker alerts**
  - Configure the `SYNTHETIC_ALERT_WEBHOOK` secret to point at the incident
    bridge (PagerDuty, Slack, Teams). Use the provided `scripts/tests/run-
synthetic-dry-run.mjs` script in staging to simulate a failure and confirm
    the webhook fires.
- **Observability dashboards**
  - Ensure Uptime-Kuma, GlitchTip/Sentry, and synthetic D1 dashboards reference
    the same run IDs so on-call engineers can pivot between sources instantly.
- **Incident banner smoke test**
  - Override the incident status endpoint (`window.__APOTHEON_SYNTHETIC_STATUS_ENDPOINT__`)
    to a mocked failure response and run `npm run test:e2e -- incident-banner`
    to prove the banner renders correctly. Attach screenshots to the change
    ticket for compliance.

## 5. Launch Communication

- **Stakeholder updates**
  - Send a launch summary including synthetic run IDs, DNS change windows, and
    rollback URLs to RevOps, Support, and the incident channel.
- **Post-launch monitoring window**
  - Keep the synthetic Worker on a 10-minute cadence for the first hour. Review
    D1 logs in the runbook to ensure latency stays inside the declared budget.

## 6. Documentation & Evidence

- Archive:
  - DNS export before/after.
  - Synthetic Worker JSON response (run ID + audit IDs).
  - Screenshots of the incident banner smoke test.
  - CI pipeline logs showing `npm run workers:synthetic:dry-run` passing.
- Store everything in `/infra/releases/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<change-id>/` so audits
  can reconstruct the launch without human memory.

Following this checklist keeps launches deterministic, reversible, and fully
observable. Every command is scriptable—if you discover a manual step, automate
it and update this document before the next release.
