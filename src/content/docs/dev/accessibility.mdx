## Automation-first testing cadence

Automation keeps accessibility debt visible. Scripts rehydrate the static Astro build and the Ladle storybook before scanning, ensuring every shipped surfaceâ€”including interactive islandsâ€”receives axe-core and Pa11y validation.

## Manual assistive technology sweeps

Perform targeted manual passes before every major milestone (feature launch, brand refresh, architecture upgrade). Document the run in the release notes checklist.

### NVDA (Windows)

1. Launch NVDA and open the production-equivalent preview URL.
2. Press `Insert + F7` and confirm the element list exposes:
   - "Banner" and "Content info" landmarks.
   - Skip link target labelled "Skip to content".
   - Region landmarks such as "Marketing content" and "Blog filters".
3. Tab through interactive controls. Confirm the skip link appears visually and focus returns to the trigger after closing dialogs (MobileNavigationDrawer).
4. Trigger form validation errors. NVDA should announce status regions like "Complete the verification challenge" immediately.
5. Submit a happy-path form; NVDA must announce confirmation text and not trap focus.

### VoiceOver (macOS)

1. Activate VoiceOver (`âŒ˜ + F5`) and load the route under review.
2. Use `Control + Option + U` to inspect the rotor:
   - Landmarks include banner, main, contentinfo, and labelled regions for CTAs.
   - Headings expose a single `<h1>` per page (MarketingHero) followed by the expected hierarchy.
3. Navigate with `Control + Option + Right Arrow`. Ensure keyboard support matches the Playwright flows (skip links, nav triggers, form controls).
4. Open the mobile navigation drawer (emulate with responsive design mode if necessary). Confirm the dialog announces its accessible name and provides skip links back to `#main`.
5. Verify modals and forms can be dismissed with `Esc` and that focus returns to the triggering element.

Log findings in the project tracker even when no issues ariseâ€”"no findings" is still a data point.

## Remediation workflow

1. **Capture** â€“ Accessibility audits output JSON under `reports/accessibility/axe/{pages,islands}` and `reports/accessibility/pa11y/{pages,islands}`. Attach relevant snippets to the ticket.
2. **Triage** â€“ Classify severity (`critical`, `serious`, `moderate`, `minor`). `critical` and `serious` halt the build automatically. `moderate` and below can be scheduled but must ship before the next release candidate.
3. **Ticketing** â€“ Create Jira issues using the `A11Y` project prefix. Template:
   - Summary: `A11Y: <component> <violation summary>`
   - Description: include reproduction steps, failing selectors, and WCAG reference.
   - Acceptance Criteria: automated axe/Pa11y pass, updated tests, manual AT verification notes.
4. **Fix** â€“ Pair engineers with design/UX as needed. Update automated tests to lock the regression out.
5. **Verify** â€“ Re-run the full command chain (`npm run accessibility:all && npm run test:e2e`). Attach screenshots or recordings from assistive technology confirmations when applicable.

## Training and enablement

- **Onboarding workshop** â€“ Schedule a quarterly 60-minute deep dive on WCAG 2.2 AA requirements, using Apotheon components as case studies. Record the session and link it in the engineering wiki.
- **Playwright lab** â€“ Provide a hands-on lab where engineers extend `tests/e2e/accessibility.spec.ts` to cover new flows. Reinforces how to validate keyboard and screen-reader parity.
- **Design partner sessions** â€“ Pair design and engineering leads monthly to review patterns (skip links, focus traps, color contrast) before they land in Figma. Document outcomes in the brand system repo.

### Standing remediation tickets

| Ticket                                           | Owner               | Status       | Notes                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A11Y-201: Monitor future axe/Pa11y regressions` | Platform Eng        | ðŸŸ¢ Scheduled | Automation runs per commit; no open blockers as of this change-set. |
| `A11Y-202: Quarterly AT refresher training`      | Developer Relations | ðŸŸ¢ Planned   | Update with recording links and attendee list after each session.   |
| `A11Y-203: Nightly audit triage rotation`        | Release Management  | ðŸŸ¢ Active    | Rotate weekly; ensure summary posted in #quality.                   |

Release gates remain green; no critical violations detected in current scans. Keep this table updated whenever audits surface new actions so leadership can trace remediation velocity.
