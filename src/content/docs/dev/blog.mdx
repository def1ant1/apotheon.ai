This playbook documents how Apotheon.ai ships enterprise-ready blog content without manual busywork. Use it alongside `docs/content/BLOG_EDITORIAL.md` for narrative guidance—the checklist below focuses on developer automation.

## Authoring workflow

1. **Start from the schema** – Every article lives in `src/content/blog/` and must satisfy the collection defined in `src/content/config.ts`. Required frontmatter now includes hero imagery, OpenGraph artwork metadata, tags, and an optional `generatorRequestId` that lets the OG Worker correlate renders with editorial requests.
2. **Capture tone + keywords inline** – Immediately after the frontmatter, add an HTML comment such as `<!-- editorial: tone="Confident" keywords="governance, ai ops" -->`. Content linting asserts that the cue exists so editors, SEO, and marketing automation stay aligned.
3. **Reference reusable assets** – Store hero art in `public/images/blog/` and social images in `public/images/og/blog/`. Use descriptive alt text; the blog post template surfaces it in the figure caption and in JSON-LD.
4. **Embed visuals** – Diagrams, quotes, and tables belong in the MDX body. Favor accessible representations (` ```text` diagrams, semantic tables) so we avoid adding dependencies for chart rendering.

## Content linting + validation

- `npm run lint` executes ESLint, Stylelint, and MDX linting. Schema violations surface as TypeScript errors thanks to the `defineCollection` contract.
- `npm run typecheck` ensures Astro components, including the new `BlogIndex` island, continue to compile with strict settings.
- `npm run test` runs Vitest suites covering blog utilities (`scoreRelatedPosts`, `buildSchemaScriptHtml`, etc.).
- `npm run test:e2e` runs Playwright scenarios that validate the `/blog` index filters, article metadata, and feed endpoints (`/rss.xml`, `/atom.xml`).
- `npm run build` compiles the static site and triggers Pagefind indexing so the search experience captures new metadata facets automatically.

## Review expectations

- **Metadata completeness** – Reviewers confirm hero art exists, OpenGraph payloads reference the correct assets, and estimated reading times are realistic.
- **Automation hooks** – Keep `openGraph.image` and `openGraph.alt` accurate. `resolveOgImage` and the RSS/Atom feeds call `ensureOgAsset`, which renders signed Worker URLs and writes the results to `src/generated/og-assets.manifest.json`. Reviewers should confirm manifest diffs align with the post being updated.
- **Accessibility + structure** – Verify headings form a logical outline, blockquotes include citations, and tables/diagrams remain readable without color.
- **Testing receipts** – Pull requests should list the release gate commands in the description. CI enforces them, but local runs catch regressions earlier.
