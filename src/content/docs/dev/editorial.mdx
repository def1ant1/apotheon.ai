This guide captures the repeatable workflow for planning, drafting, and shipping
Apotheon.ai blog posts without breaking the automation that protects the rest of
our platform. Treat it as the canonical runbook—update it whenever the content
schema, layouts, or review stages evolve. Pair it with
[`docs/content/CALENDAR.md`](/docs/content/calendar/) so onboarding teammates can
see how GrowthBook experiments map to each rolling content drop.

## 1. Start from a commented template

1. Copy an existing file from `src/content/blog/`. The production-ready article
   (`federated-risk-mesh.mdx`) demonstrates final polish while the draft
   examples (`ai-vendor-scorecards.mdx`, `lightweight-assurance-patterns.mdx`)
   show how to keep metadata current during outlines.
2. Keep every frontmatter comment intact. They document which fields are
   required, what formatting we expect, and the editorial workflow (draft gate,
   hero asset expectations, etc.). Tooling parses these comments when we add new
   checks, so deleting them slows future automation.
3. Update the metadata before touching the body copy. `npm run typecheck`
   validates the schema in seconds and catches typos like malformed dates or
   missing author links.

### Frontmatter quick reference

| Field                     | Required | Notes                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`                   | ✅       | 60–90 characters, action-oriented. Powers `<title>` and JSON-LD `headline`.     |
| `description`             | ✅       | 140–160 characters for SEO/social cards.                                        |
| `publishDate`             | ✅       | ISO-8601 date representing the intended go-live. Drives ordering + RSS.         |
| `updatedDate`             | ➖       | Add when substantive edits go live post-launch.                                 |
| `heroImage`               | ➖       | Reference artwork under `/public/images/blog`. SVG preferred.                   |
| `heroImageAlt`            | ➖       | Required when `heroImage` is provided. Plain-language summary.                  |
| `tags`                    | ✅       | Lowercase kebab-case tokens. Fuel search facets + related content scoring.      |
| `estimatedReadingMinutes` | ✅       | Whole number derived from reading-time automation.                              |
| `author`                  | ✅       | Includes name, optional title/avatar, short bio, and optional links.            |
| `draft`                   | ✅       | `true` hides the entry from production builds. Flip to `false` when publishing. |

## 2. Build and preview with drafts

- `npm run dev` → Standard hot reload server. Drafts render automatically.
- `npm run dev -- --drafts` → Mirrors production routing while keeping draft
  content visible. Use this when testing pagination or related-posts logic.
- `npm run build -- --drafts` → Generates a static build with drafts included.
  Pair with `npm run preview` for stakeholder reviews without toggling the
  `draft` flag.

## 3. Submit for review

1. Run the full quality gate locally: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`,
   `npm run build`, `npm run test`.
2. Capture outstanding editorial tasks inside the MDX body using checklists.
   They provide context for reviewers and double as a QA reminder before you
   flip `draft` to `false`.
3. Reference this playbook and `docs/dev/WORKFLOWS.md` in the PR description so
   reviewers know which automation already ran.

## 4. Publish confidently

1. Replace any placeholder assets, ensure call-to-action URLs resolve, and set
   `draft: false`.
2. Re-run the quality gate (commands above). Production builds will now include
   the article and expose JSON-LD article schema via `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro`.
3. After merge, monitor the next scheduled deployment for any warnings. The
   blog index already sorts by `publishDate`; no manual reordering is necessary.
4. If you edit the article later, add an `updatedDate` so structured data stays
   accurate and readers know the content is fresh.

Maintaining this workflow keeps the blog automation-friendly and ensures every
new piece ships with enterprise-grade observability, accessibility, and SEO
signals baked in.
