Industry narratives moved into the dedicated `src/content/industries` collection so editors capture compliance-first messaging without touching templates. Every entry is validated by Zod at build time and rendered through hydration-free Astro components.

> **2024 IA requirement:** The finance route is canonicalized at `/industries/finance`. Keep the file name, nav slug, CTA query params, and any supporting assets aligned with `finance`—older `financial-services` paths are permanently retired.

## Schema Overview

Each MDX file must satisfy the schema exported from `src/content/industries/index.ts`:

- `title` – Human-readable page title shared with metadata and breadcrumbs.
- `order` – Integer used for landing-page ordering.
- `featured` – Boolean flag that adds “Priority vertical” styling on list views.
- `hero` – Object containing `eyebrow`, `headline`, `copy`, and an `icon` slug. Icons map to SVG components defined in `src/components/icons` via `src/components/industries/icon-map.ts`.
- `pressures` – Array of three (or more) sector headwinds with optional `metric` proof points.
- `complianceHighlights` – Array that records the framework, Apotheon.ai coverage, and optional evidence string (attestation name, control IDs, etc.).
- `solutionMap` – Array of objects with a `slug` that must match an entry in `src/content/solutions`, plus `positioning` and optional `outcome`. Builds fail if a slug is unknown.
- `useCases` – Persona-aligned scenarios describing how the platform activates within the sector.
- `ctas` – Object containing `demo` and `whitepaper` CTA definitions (label, href, optional description/aria label).
- `seo.description` – Optional meta-description override when the hero copy is not SEO ready.

Inline HTML comments inside each MDX file capture tone guidance (e.g., compliance-first language, keyword density targets, regulator messaging). Preserve and update those comments when revising copy so future authors inherit the editorial guardrails.

## Icon Directory

Use the following icon slugs inside `hero.icon`:

| Slug            | Component                   | Usage Notes                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `finance`       | `IndustryFinanceIcon`       | Financial services, banking, insurance         |
| `healthcare`    | `IndustryHealthcareIcon`    | Provider, payer, life sciences                 |
| `public-sector` | `IndustryPublicSectorIcon`  | Federal, state, municipal missions             |
| `energy`        | `IndustryEnergyIcon`        | Utility and energy transformation              |
| `manufacturing` | `IndustryManufacturingIcon` | Industrial, logistics, and supply chain        |
| `transport`     | `IndustryTransportIcon`     | Aviation, rail, autonomous mobility            |
| `law`           | `IndustryLawIcon`           | Law firms, corporate counsel, regulatory teams |
| `government`    | `IndustryGovernmentIcon`    | State, local, and civic digital services       |
| `military`      | `IndustryMilitaryIcon`      | Defense mission systems and software factories |
| `intelligence`  | `IndustryIntelligenceIcon`  | National and commercial intelligence programs  |

Icons render server-side and never hydrate; no additional directives are required. Open a follow-up ticket before adding new icons so the shared map and documentation stay in sync.

> **Automation reminder:** add the raw SVG under `assets/brand-icons/raw/`, run `npm run icons:build`, and append the slug to `src/content/industries/iconSlugs.ts` so validation stays automatic.

## Editorial Workflow

1. Duplicate an existing MDX file in `src/content/industries/` to inherit inline tone/compliance comments.
2. Update frontmatter fields:
   - Align `pressures` and `complianceHighlights` with the current GTM storyline and include a measurable `metric` wherever possible.
   - Reference canonical solution slugs in `solutionMap`. Run `npm run typecheck`—the schema refuses to build when slugs are missing or misspelled.
   - Refresh `ctas` to point at the latest demo flow and gated asset.
3. Adjust or append body comments documenting tone, keyword density, and compliance messaging decisions.
4. Run the release gate locally:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   npm run test
   npm run test:e2e
   npm run build
   npm run ladle:build
   ```
5. Capture any notable decisions (new frameworks, solution pairings, regulatory notes) in the pull-request summary so GTM and compliance stakeholders can cross-check quickly.

## Template Behavior

`src/pages/industries/[sector].astro` renders structured data via dedicated components:

1. `<IndustryHero>` – Surfaces hero copy + icon with semantic landmarks.
2. `<IndustryPressures>` – Lists market pressures as a definition list with optional metrics.
3. `<IndustrySolutionMap>` – Auto-links validated solution references.
4. `<IndustryUseCases>` – Highlights persona-specific workflows.
5. `<IndustryCompliance>` – Calls out frameworks and evidence strings.
6. `<IndustryCtaBanner>` – Offers both demo and whitepaper CTAs.

The landing page (`src/pages/industries/index.astro`) pulls from the same collection, rendering icons on every card and exposing analytics-friendly IDs (`industry-card-<slug>`). No manual updates are required when adding or reordering industries.

## Release Gate Reminder

Industry changes ship only after running the full command set listed above. The Vitest suite under `src/components/industries/__tests__/` snapshots each section and confirms solution lookups remain accurate, providing fast feedback during editorial cycles.
