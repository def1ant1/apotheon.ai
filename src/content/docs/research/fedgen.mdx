  `assets/whitepapers/managed-assets.json` with fresh checksums. 3. Execute `npm
  run test && npm run build` to rebuild automation reports and ensure CI parity
  before publishing. 4. Commit the regenerated manifest entries alongside any
  README or landing page copy updates so reviewers can trace metrics to source
  artifacts.

> **Purpose:** Document the pipeline that generates and distributes the FEDGEN (Federated Governance) investor whitepaper referenced across the README, homepage product stack, and diligence packets.

## Asset Generation Workflow

1. Author or update the MDX source under `src/content/whitepapers/` (e.g., `fedgen-operational-oversight.mdx`).
2. Run `npm run ensure:whitepapers` to regenerate PDFs and update `assets/whitepapers/managed-assets.json` with fresh checksums.
3. Execute `npm run test && npm run build` to rebuild automation reports and ensure CI parity before publishing.
4. Commit the regenerated manifest entries alongside any README or landing page copy updates so reviewers can trace metrics to source artifacts.

## Distribution & Access Controls

- **Primary funnel:** `/about/white-papers/?whitepaperSlug=apotheon-investor-brief#whitepaper-request` issues signed URLs via the Workers delivery proxy. Update the slug once the dedicated FEDGEN MDX ships.
- **Synthetic monitoring:** `npm run test:synthetic` validates that the whitepaper Worker can mint download URLs and persist audit trails to D1.
- **Investor notifications:** Coordinate with RevOps to schedule GOV/IR email drops immediately after PDFs regenerate. The BWCCUM orchestration metrics in the README table must match the PDF appendix.

## Signal Taxonomy Custody

- **Coverage:** Runtime metrics exported from BWCCUM lanes, policy attestation deltas from Themis, and consent summaries from Mnemosyne.
- **Storage:** Persist sanitized aggregates in the FEDGEN section of `assets/whitepapers/managed-assets.json`. Never embed raw customer data.
- **Review cadence:** Quarterly (or sooner if regulatory policy shifts). Always rerun `npm run ensure:whitepapers` and refresh README metrics in the same change set.
