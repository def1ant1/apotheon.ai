> **Purpose:** Centralize the automation guardrails, consent policies, and distribution hooks for the Trace Synthesis research cited across homepage modules and investor collateral.

## Data Pipeline Overview

1. Capture orchestrated traces from BWCCUM lanes with PII scrubbed at the edge.
2. Themis evaluates compliance posture and annotates the dataset with jurisdictional gating metadata.
3. Mnemosyne packages approved aggregates for activation while Hermes exposes scenario sandboxes for RevOps and partner enablement.

## Drift Appendix Automation Contract

- **Source MDX:** `src/content/whitepapers/trace-synthesis.mdx` (placeholder until research publish). Update metrics directly in MDX so the PDF export stays authoritative.
- **Generation:** Run `npm run ensure:whitepapers` to produce the appendix PDF and refresh the manifest ledger before touching README or landing summaries.
- **Verification:** Execute `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build` to confirm automation parity and Lighthouse budgets after copy changes.

## Download & Consent Workflow

- **Investor access:** Route visitors through `/about/white-papers/?whitepaperSlug=strategic-automation-playbook#whitepaper-request` until the dedicated Trace Synthesis slug ships.
- **Consent logging:** The whitepaper Worker persists consent receipts to D1; confirm the records via `npm run test:synthetic` in CI for every change.
- **Revocation handling:** Mnemosyne automatically propagates opt-outs to BWCCUM lanes. Document escalations in the consent ledger referenced in homepage copy.
