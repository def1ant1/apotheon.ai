Our marketing stack favors content-driven automation so teams scale storytelling without manually
wiring routes. Use this reference to understand how content collections, Astro templates, and shared
components cooperate during `npm run build`.

## Content Collections

- **Location:** `src/content/marketing/` organized into `solutions/`, `industries/`, and `about/`.
- **Schema:** Each MDX file uses the marketing collection schema defined in
  `src/content/config.ts` (`title`, `summary`, `heroCtaLabel`, `order`, `featured`).
- **Authoring Guidance:** Inline MDX comments inside every document describe hero usage, CTA
  wiring, and extensibility options (e.g., embedding MDX components). Keep the comments updated as
  templates evolve so new contributors know which layout slot each section targets.

## Page Templates

- **Dynamic routes:**
  - `src/pages/solutions/[product].astro`
  - `src/pages/industries/[sector].astro`
  - `src/pages/about/[page].astro`

  Each template calls `getCollection('marketing')`, filters by folder prefix, and feeds the MDX
  content into reusable marketing components. The routes are fully staticâ€”no client-side routing or
  hydration occurs outside optional islands authors may embed later.

- **Index routes:**
  - `src/pages/solutions/index.astro`
  - `src/pages/industries/index.astro`
  - `src/pages/about/index.astro`

  These pages render navigation grids and precompute breadcrumb arrays. When the breadcrumb helper
  ships, the same data can be forwarded without changing the collection authoring flow.

## Shared Components

- `src/components/marketing/MarketingShell.astro` centralizes metadata, breadcrumb rendering, and
  layout spacing. Use it to guarantee consistent SEO tags and document structure.
- `src/components/marketing/MarketingHero.astro` standardizes hero presentation with accessible
  button styling and copy length guidance.
- `src/components/marketing/MarketingCtaRow.astro` prevents duplicate CTA markup while outlining
  performance and analytics considerations.

Future additions (e.g., testimonial sliders, pricing tables) should follow the same pattern: create a
component inside `src/components/marketing/`, annotate it thoroughly, and import it from page
templates instead of duplicating markup.

## Build & Validation Flow

Run the following commands before shipping marketing updates:

1. `npm run lint`
2. `npm run typecheck`
3. `npm run build`
4. `npm run test`

`npm run build` exports static HTML for every marketing route, including new MDX entries, ensuring we
ship a CDN-ready artifact without manual intervention.
