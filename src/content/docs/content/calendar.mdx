Apotheon.ai ships content and experiments on a rolling four-week cadence so
marketing, product, and growth engineering can plan against the same signal. Use
this calendar alongside `docs/dev/EDITORIAL.md` when onboarding new
contributors—the dates below anchor GrowthBook experiments to the release notes
and campaign assets that go live each week.

## Cadence Overview

| Week | Content Focus                               | Experiment Focus                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Publish flagship thought-leadership piece.  | Launch experiment to validate new hero messaging. |
| 2    | Release industry-specific follow-up blog.   | Tune CTA surfaces based on Week 1 performance.    |
| 3    | Publish technical implementation deep dive. | Roll out support experience experiments.          |
| 4    | Ship customer proof-point or case study.    | Retire stale variants and prep next cycle.        |

- **Content drops** move on Tuesdays to keep SEO recrawls predictable. Use the
  shared OG automation (`npm run ensure:og-assets`) the day prior so the social
  preview pipeline stays warm.
- **GrowthBook experiments** should target a single KPI per cycle. Capture the
  flag key, hypothesis, and exit criteria in the GrowthBook description—CI reads
  the metadata to populate dashboards.
- **Freeze windows** begin Thursday 18:00 UTC. Avoid flipping experiments after
  the freeze unless the change mitigates a production incident.

## Workflow Integration

1. Populate GrowthBook with upcoming experiment definitions at least one week in
   advance. The CI sync (`npm run experiments:sync`) fetches the latest payload
   from the OSS instance and caches it in the `experiments-proxy` Worker.
2. When authoring MDX drafts tagged `social-campaign`, coordinate copy edits
   with the OG automation. The refreshed Twitter cards land in
   `public/images/social/` and are referenced in release briefings.
3. Update this calendar when cadence shifts. Review the entry during quarterly
   planning so marketing, RevOps, and engineering stay aligned on which features
   and content will be under test.

## Onboarding Checklist

- Read `docs/dev/EDITORIAL.md` for the full publishing workflow.
- Pair with the growth engineer owning GrowthBook to understand active
  experiments.
- Run `npm run experiments:sync -- --dry-run` locally to confirm access to the
  Worker endpoint and secrets.
- Confirm OG assets regenerate successfully (`npm run ensure:og-assets`).

Treat this document as living infrastructure—update it whenever cadence,
stakeholders, or experiment governance changes.
