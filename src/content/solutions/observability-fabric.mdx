# Diagram editorial expectations:
# - Keep `diagram.slug` aligned with the source SVG filename under assets/solutions-diagrams/raw/.
# - Summarize the story in `diagram.alt` for screen readers without repeating visible captions.
# - Use `diagram.caption` to translate the visual into a clear business outcome or operational win.
